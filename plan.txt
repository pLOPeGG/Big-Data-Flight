Presentation Big Data:

Topic: Plane trajectory efficiency

I./ Data
	a) ADS-B data
		- Fields
		- How it's obtained
		- Our data -> 2017 / jan
	b) Airports
		- Fields
		- Who provides it -> http://www.partow.net/miscellaneous/airportdatabase/index.html#Downloads

II./ Process
	a) Filtering
		- Missing values
		- Europe only
		- Value missmatch
	b) Splitting in trips
		- Preparation:
			- Grouping by plane ICAO (ID)
			- Sorting by time
		- Discovering splitting points:
			- Altitude is at a local minimum
			- Target Altitude is on a constant OR local minimum point
			- Target Altitude (onboard computer) is set on a value lower than the cruising value
			- Threshold computed on nearby airports maximum altitude is higher than plane's altitude
		- Additionnal splits:
			- When timestep separating two sequential points is greater than a threshold (half an hour) -> split
		- Post process:
			- Identify starting airport and ending airport
			- A trip never link an airport to itself

III./ Results
